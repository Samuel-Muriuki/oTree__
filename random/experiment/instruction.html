            Both participants will then receive a list of messages that they could use for communication if their role
            is A. For each joint project, one round of one way communication from A to B is allowed. A can choose either
            to use the picked message or not.
        </p>
        <p>
            Without knowing the actual role, each participant will be assumed the role of A to rank all the provided
            messages according to how desirable they are. The most desirable message should be ranked first while the
            least desirable message should be ranked last. Only the message that is ranked first can be used for
            communication if the participant's role is revealed to be A. The participant will also guess the most
            popular message (i.e., ranking first) picked by other participants when they face exactly the same project
            (i.e., same payoff and same division between A and B) in the same session. If the guess is correct (measured
            by the mode of the actual selected message in the same session, in case of a draw, the correct answer will
            be randomly decided), The participant will receive a bonus payoff of $50.
